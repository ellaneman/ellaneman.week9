        <h2> Ella Neman: Final Site Proposal </h2>


        <h3>PROPOSAL:</h3>
        <p>For my final site I will be creating a personal website for my cousin Ryan Daneshrad, who is a lawyer, as a birthday present. The site will show his work, his contact information, and a bunch of content showcasing his law work. This upcoming weekend I will be sitting down with him to draft up what he wants included in the site. All in all I would like to create a very clean and minimal site, which to me gives off more of a sophisticated/professional aesthetic, especially to someone in his field of work. When researching different sites as examples the one that really stood out to me was the site for <a href="https://calgarydefence.com">Roulston UrquhartÂ Criminal Defense</a> team, which exemplifies the aesthetic I would lie to achieve on my future site. </p>
